# Brain Memory KB

Unified interface for integrated `~/ai-brain/` operations.

## Modes

- `memory` mode:
  - read/write/update/supersede memory entities
  - maintain compact orchestration context
- `kb-query` mode:
  - index-first KB lookup
  - escalate depth only when needed
- `promote` mode:
  - promote high-value memory entries into durable KB nodes
  - set memory source pointer/superseded state

## Default Policy

- Memory behaves like RAM (short-lived, operational, compact).
- KB behaves like HDD (durable, canonical, reusable).
- Query ladder: L0/L1 default, L2/L3 on explicit escalation.

## Operator profile

- **`~/ai-brain/org/global/operator-profile/`** — see **`_templates/operator-profile.md`**; **PII** vs **secrets** per **`brain-conventions.md`**.

## Promotion Triggers

Promote when item is:

- reused across runs
- used by multiple entrypoint agents
- repeatedly queried during orchestration
- stable decision/constraint/risk/principle

## Compatibility

- Canonical interface is `brain-memory-kb`.
